If you are not subject to VAT, use the available setting 'Apply tax exoneration'. An 'exoneration' box will appear at the bottom of the screen.

The 'auto-settings' option allows you to set up all of your country's VAT rates at once, rather than doing so one by one. Simply select the country you live in and the different tax rates will appear underneath.
